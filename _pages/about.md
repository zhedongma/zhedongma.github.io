I am currently an iPhone/iPad System Power Integrity & EMI Engineer at Apple Inc., Austin, TX, USA. I received my Ph.D. degree in Power Electronics & EMI from the University of Florida in 2023 supervised by [Prof.Shuo Wang](https://peeprlgator.github.io/Shuo.Wang/index.html). During my Ph.D. study, I worked closely with [Honggang Sheng](https://research.google/people/HonggangSheng/) and [Srikanth Lakshmikanthan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikanth-lakshmikanthan-7995478/) at Google Inc. on Google's consumer products (AC/DC power adapters, Wireless chargers, Pixel phones, Earbuds, etc.). I was the recipient of the __Best Presentation Award__ from the 2023 IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC). I have over 30 publications in IEEE leading Transactions/Journal/Conference in my 4 years of Ph.D. study. My research in power electronics EMI is widely cited and prompted in the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society [Newsletter](https://engage.ieee.org/index.php/email/emailWebview?md_id=75429&email=NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGPHVbZSLMwhhzcdx88QEaFbsZgUu2gbNmOB_6-HCWs26ao005WmumjGdu6qve6Zp_aK70-2O4ajeAYcaNZVBbLldRiszFQSi_1Fg) (>10k members all over the world).

I received my B.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Automation from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China in June 2019. During my undergraduate study, I was honored to be awarded "Top-ten Outstanding University Students at Zhejiang University (Lantian Academy) (10/4000+)" in 2017 and "Outstanding Graduates of Zhejiang University" in 2019.

In my daily life, I enjoy swimming, traveling as well as photographing a lot, you can see the pictures that I took along the journey in [Photo show](https://zhedongma.github.io/portfolio/).
